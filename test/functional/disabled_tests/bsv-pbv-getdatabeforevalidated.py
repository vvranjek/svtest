First test (__test_getdata):

1. Send block via p2p connection (block validation completion is delayed)
2. Request get data before it is validated
3. Complete validation
4. After validation is complete we should get the delayed block reply for get
   data request sent earlier.

This case can happen because we announce a block immediately after receiving it
and performing some basic checks on it. On such messages nodes react by requesting
a compact block but there are cases when compact block is discarded and in such
cases getblock is used to request the entire block - in case this request comes
before we finished validation we need to defer the response and not consume it
without replying.

Second test (__test_getblocks):

1. Send block1 via p2p connection (block validation completion is delayed)
2. Request get blocks before it is validated
2. Send block2 via p2p connection (block validation completion is delayed)
3. Complete validation of block1
4. After validation is complete we should get the delayed block reply for get
   blocks request sent earlier even though block2 is still not validated (as the
   request has been made before that point)
5. Complete validation of block2 just to finish the test
