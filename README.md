Bitcoin SV
===========

What is Bitcoin SV?
-------------------

[Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision)](https://bitcoinsv.io/) is the original Bitcoin.  It restores the original Bitcoin 
protocol, will keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.  Bitcoin SV will maintain the vision set out by Satoshi 
Nakamotoâ€™s white paper in 2008.  This Github repository provides open-source software to enable use of Bitcoin SV.
